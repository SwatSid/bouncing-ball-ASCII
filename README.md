Simple Bouncing ball physics simulation in 1 dimension using ASCII visualization

Left most part of the screen is considered as the floor towards which gravitational acceleration is pointed. Given initial distance from the floor and initial velocity (positive for up and negative for down), the ball would bounce against the floor with specified coefficient of restitution e (ranging from 0 to 1, 0 being inelastic bounce and 1 being perfectly elastic bounce).
